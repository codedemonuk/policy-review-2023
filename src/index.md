- Community Safety Team Staffing
- Partnership Plan 2023 – 2027
- Action Plan 2023 – 2024

Note:

### Community Safety Team Staffing

After 23 years Valerie Kane is retiring from the council.
Loran Kingston will be taking over the Community Safety Managers role, Holly Wilson was covering Loran’s maternity leave is now permanent and will be the Community Safety Intervention Officer and Linda Hammond, who joined the team a year ago, is the Partnership Support Officer.

### Partnership Plan 2023 – 2027

Crime trends, data sources and the results of our Feelings of Safety survey were used to update the aims and priorities set out in the Partnership Plan for 2023-2027.
These aims and priorities were put out to public consultation at the beginning of January and closed on 20 February, with 329 responses being received.
The feedback from the consultation will be captured within the draft Partnership Plan, which will be presented to the Community Safety Board in March 2023.

### Action Plan 2023 – 2024

In April 2023 community safety partners will agree the actions that will be taken to ensure the priorities set out in the new Partnership Plan are achieved.
The action plan will be monitored by the Hertsmere Community Safety Board on a quarterly basis.

- Prevent Action Plan 2023 – 2024
- Serious Violence Duty
- Community Trigger

Note:

### Prevent Action Plan 2023 – 2024

The Community Safety Team are working closely with the County Council’s Prevent Programme Manager to update and implement the Prevent Action Plan 2023 – 2024 for Hertsmere.

### Serious Violence Duty

At the end of January the Serious Violence Duty was introduced and the Community Safety Team are working with the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) and the County Community Safety Unit (CCSU) to support the delivery of this duty in Hertsmere.
The Serious Violence Duty will require local authorities, the police, fire and rescue authorities, specified criminal justice agencies and health authorities to work together to formulate an evidence based analysis of the problems associated with serious violence in a local area, and then produce and implement a strategy detailing how they will respond to those particular issues. Prisons, youth custody agencies and educational authorities may also need to work with these core partners.

### Community Trigger

The Community Safety Team are currently incorporating the recommendations made by the OPCC and the CCSU.
The team will ensure the Community Trigger is widely promoted and accessible and they will be proactive in identifying cases where there are repeat victims of anti-social behaviour.

- Improving partnership working
- Cannabis warning partnership pilot
- Herts Mind Network

Note:

### Improving partnership working

Towards the end of last year meetings were held with Redthread and Deputy Director Nursing & Quality, Hertfordshire and West Essex Integrated Care Board to understand the roles of these partners, to improve partnership working and to encourage attendance at the necessary community safety meetings.  Further meetings are due to take place in February.

The Community Safety Team are represented at the Police’s Daily Tasking Meeting (DTM) between Monday and Friday.
At these meetings the police share details of the crime and incidents that occur overnight.

### Cannabis warning partnership pilot

At the beginning of January a three month cannabis warning pilot was launched.
The Community Safety Team co-ordinate the pilot by working with the police, housing associations and residents to identify individuals who are using cannabis in their residential properties.  Those responsible will be written to and made aware of the consequences should they continue.
The pilot will be regularly reviewed and if successful it will be adopted by the partnership to use as a tool for tackling cannabis use in residential properties.

### Herts Mind Network

Approval has been sought and granted for Mind to run a Crisis Café at Number 10 Leeming Road similar to those run in Stevenage, Watford and Ware, which provide a safe haven for those in crisis, during the evening. This service will enhance the work of our Community Support Service.

Mind has seen a huge increase in demand for their services across the county and we have seen this locally where the waiting list for our Community Support Service has been temporarily closed as the service has reached its capacity.  Contact is still being made with any new referrals - they are signposted to other services in the meantime and are given the necessary contact details should their circumstances dramatically change for the worse.

Funding was secured to extend the service to March 2023 and work continues to find funding for the next financial year.
We are awaiting the outcome of the £50k bid made to the Govia Thameslink ‘Your Station, Your Community’ fund, in respect of this service, in July last year.
Successful candidates will be advised during March.

- No More Service
- Funding
- Milby Court engagement, Borehamwood

Note:

### No More Service

The CSP has agreed to continue to fund The No More Youth Service for another year.  This service offers complex needs support to individuals to tackle issues which negatively impact on their daily life. They offer intensive support to prolific offenders and those associated with gang, knife crime, anti-social behaviour and county lines and work with individuals up to age 21 or 25 with special educational needs.
Hertsmere has 1 No More Service worker who also covers Watford and Three Rivers.

### Funding

The Community Safety Team have submitted a joint proposal to the OPCC under the Serious Violence sub-theme area of Education / Prevention in Schools.
The proposal will include a series of educational talks and events at primary and secondary schools with the aim to raise awareness of Violence Against Woman and Girls (VAWGs), the consequences of being involved in anti-social behaviour (ASB), crime, gangs, knife crime and child / criminal sexual exploitation.
The proposal has been jointly submitted with East Herts, Three Rivers and Welwyn Hatfield CSPs.

A total of £11,000 of funding has been awarded by Hertfordshire County Council’s Building Life Chances and the police’s Safer Neighbourhood Initiative Fund (SNIF).
This funding will support the delivery of positive diversionary activities for young people in Bushey as well as educational sessions and events to raise awareness of topics such as exploitation, drugs, healthy relationships, gangs and knife crime.

In Bushey £1,700 of funding has been received from the borough councillors Ward Initiative Improvement Scheme (WIIS) and from the County Council’s Locality Budget Scheme to fund.  This funding has purchased light timers for residents to assist in preventing them from becoming a victim of burglary.  The light timers are used to plug in lamps and TVs to make a property look occupied even when no one is home.

### Milby Court engagement, Borehamwood

Work continues with the Community Safety Team, police and Clarion to address an increase of ASB and criminal damage in this area.

Note:

### Meadow Park, Borehamwood

Work is being done to address the ASB and drug use / dealing in Meadow Park.
In February representatives from the Community Safety Team, police, Hertfordshire CCTV Partnership and the council’s Parks Department took part in a visual audit.
Following this visit a number of actions have been agreed including more temporary CCTV, extra patrols and bins and asb surveys being delivered to local residents.

### Personal Safety

The Community Safety Team are working with the Community Security Trust (CST) to deliver a number of personal safety events across the borough during April, May and June to improve resident’s safety and reduce the opportunities for becoming victims of crime.

### CCTV

The Community Safety Team continues to work with the police and other colleagues to identify ‘hot spot’ areas to ensure our full complement of mobile CCTV cameras are fully utilised.

A number of the static CCTV cameras have already been upgraded as part of the Home Office’s Safer Streets project.
Work is currently underway to upgrade the remaining cameras across the borough.
